## About

This project helps split bills and shared expenses between multiple people. It provides an easy way to add expenses, assign participants, and compute who owes whom.

> Note: I created this README based on the repository name and language composition (TypeScript + JavaScript). If you'd like the README customized to the actual project functionality, share a brief description or point me to the main source files and I will update it.

## Features

- Add expenses with amount, payer, and participants
- Calculate per-person shares and balances
- Export or print settlement summary
- Minimal, dependency-light implementation (TypeScript core with optional JS adapters)

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript (primary)
- JavaScript (secondary)
- Node.js for CLI or backend utilities
